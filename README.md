## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Flask / FastAPI (for deployment)

### **Frontend**

The **Frontend** is built using **React** (or any other JS framework/library) and communicates with the backend to handle plant image uploads and show predictions.

#### 1. **App.js**
- The main React component that holds the structure and routing of the app.
- It includes the image upload form, prediction result display, and necessary state management.

#### 2. **PlantUpload.js**
- A component that allows users to upload images of plants.
- It communicates with the backend through an API (REST or GraphQL) to send the image for classification.
  
#### 3. **index.html**
- The main HTML page for the frontend, where the app is mounted.
- Links to static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

#### 4. **package.json**
- Contains frontend dependencies like React, Axios (for API calls), and other necessary libraries.

---

### **Backend**

The **Backend** is a **Flask** or **FastAPI** application that serves the trained deep learning model for plant classification.

#### 1. **app.py**
- The main entry point for the backend. This file initializes the Flask/FastAPI app, sets up routes, and handles requests from the frontend.

#### 2. **routes.py**
- Contains the API routes for handling requests from the frontend, like image uploads and model predictions.

#### 3. **model.py**
- Loads the trained model and performs inference (prediction) based on the uploaded image.
- It may preprocess the image before passing it to the model for prediction.

#### 4. **utils.py**
- Includes helper functions for image preprocessing (resizing, normalization), saving/loading the model, and other utility tasks.

#### 5. **trained_model/** 
- Contains the trained deep learning model file (e.g., `plant_model.h5`), which is loaded by the backend for inference.

#### 6. **requirements.txt**
- Contains Python dependencies required for the backend, including Flask/FastAPI, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and any other libraries used for model deployment.

---

### **Model**

This directory contains everything related to training and saving the deep learning model.

#### 1. **plant_model.h5**
- The saved model file in Keras/TensorFlow format. This file is used by the backend for predictions.

#### 2. **training_scripts/**
- Contains scripts for training the deep learning model, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and training pipeline.

#### 3. **README.md**
- Describes the model, training process, and any considerations when using or modifying the model.

### **Key Flow of the Project**

1. **Frontend**:
   - User uploads an image of a plant.
   - The image is sent to the **Backend** API for classification via HTTP (e.g., POST request).

2. **Backend**:
   - The backend receives the image and preprocesses it.
   - The image is passed to the **Model** (using `model.py`) for prediction.
   - The result (plant name, medicinal properties) is sent back to the frontend.

3. **Frontend**:
   - Displays the prediction result to the user.

---

### **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React.js (or Vue.js/Angular), Axios (for API calls), HTML/CSS
- **Backend**: Flask/FastAPI, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model), OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- **Model**: Pre-trained deep learning model (CNN), Keras/TensorFlow
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional), Cloud (AWS/GCP for hosting)

This structure will help you organize the codebase into clear sections, making it easier to develop, maintain, and deploy the application.
