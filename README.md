## Project Description
The **Medicinal Plant Identification** system is designed to classify medicinal plants from images using deep learning models. The project involves image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Users can upload plant images and get accurate identification results using a trained CNN model.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: PlantVillage or Custom Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset consists of labeled images of various medicinal plants. Each plant image is categorized by its species name and associated medicinal properties.
- **Source**: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset) or Custom Dataset

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Flask / FastAPI (for deployment)
- Matplotlib (for plotting results)

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are used for extracting spatial features from plant images.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3 are used to enhance performance with fewer training data.
- **Custom CNN Layers**: Designed to process images for plant identification.
  
## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medicinal-plant-identification.git
   cd medicinal-plant-identification

2.  Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
